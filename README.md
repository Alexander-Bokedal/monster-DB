### How to work in this project:

In CMD
1. Use "git clone https://github.com/Alexander-Bokedal/monster-DB" on your computer to create a local repo
2. Use "git checkout -b "name-of-branch"" to create a new branch where you work on features
3. When you are happy with changes on your branch, use "git add ." and "git commit -m "message""
4. Use "git checkout main" and use "git pull" to check if your main is up to date
5. use "git checkout "your-branch"" to go to your own branch.
6. Use "git merge main" to see if your branch is compatiable with main
7. Use "git checkout main" and then "git merge "your-branch"
8. Use "git push" to upload your changes to the online repository

ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU ARE WORKING ON A BRANCH. NEVER WORK ON THE MAIN BRANCH

Name branches like follows:
"lowercase-letters"
